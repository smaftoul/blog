The project: Manage properly and nicely a domain, with code and free resources.
Called other-hosted, because it uses resources provdided for free by other company, it's the contrary of self-hosted.

So far, I have:
* a domain
* a DNS registrar (cloudflare)
* a catch-all MX (cldouflare)
* a code repository (github)
* some CI (github actions)
* a terraform state storage (Hashicorp Cloud Platform)
* this static blog (eleventy, cloudflare workers)
